🌿 MindCare Hub

A MERN-based Mental Wellness Tracking Platform

📝 Abstract
Mental health is a crucial component of overall well-being, yet it is often overlooked due to stigma, lack of awareness, and limited access to professional care. With rising cases of stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders, the need for accessible digital self-care tools has never been greater.
MindCare Hub is a full-stack MERN web application designed to help users track, monitor, and enhance their mental wellness. The platform offers mood and stress tracking, data visualization, personalized healing roadmaps, daily affirmations, and reminders. It also lays the foundation for future capabilities such as therapist integration and AI-assisted mental health support.
With a secure and user-friendly interface, MindCare Hub empowers individuals to take meaningful steps toward their psychological well-being.

📌 Introduction
Modern lifestyles have made mental health issues like anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia increasingly common. Many avoid therapy due to social stigma or lack of resources, resulting in worsening conditions. Digital mental health platforms offer accessible, stigma-free, and affordable alternatives.
MindCare Hub, an initiative by Savyas Heal, is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides users with tools to record emotions, track stress levels, monitor sleep cycles, and visualize their progress through interactive reports. Features like customized self-care recommendations, affirmations, and reminder notifications support consistent self-improvement and emotional balance.

Future enhancements may include:
✔ AI-driven mental health chatbots
✔ Therapist video consultations
✔ Wearable device integration
